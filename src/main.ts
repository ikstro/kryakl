// Kryakl's main process. It lives in the tray and waits for a text:
//   - Ctrl+C twice in any program, or the listen key: the selected text;
//   - the snip key (Ctrl+Alt+S): Windows' own snipping overlay opens, and the
//     piece of the screen it puts on the clipboard is read with the OCR built
//     into Windows.
// The text is translated offline and shown in the card, a small window by the
// pointer: the text in English on top, read aloud by the natural voice or a
// system one, and its translation under it. Closing the card silences it.
// The translate keys (the selection, Ctrl+Alt+T for a piece of the screen)
// show the same card as a translator instead: the text as it is and its
// translation, from the language it is in into the person's own (from theirs
// into English), the two languages to change or swap.
//
// The app window (media/app.html) holds the notebook of saved words, the
// settings and how to use; the tray menu has the quick switches. The keyboard
// helper (keyboard.ts, kbd-worker.ts) switches and fixes layouts as one types.
// The speech engine (speechhost.ts: Python, installed in parts when first
// wanted) serves Dictate (dictation.ts), Transcribe and the Chrome extension.
